This repository contains data and analysis codes to reproduce the main results in the paper.

# To ensure anonymity of participants we removed background variables (education and income) from this public data set
and we transformed the age variable into a categorical variable, with four age bins (see variable label for description).
This means that our main results that used age and sex as control variables cannot not exactly be reproduced by these files,
but the discrepancy is very small. Results from the Qb-test were also excluded because of the sensitive nature of these data.
